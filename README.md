# OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Lab

<h1>Introduction</h1>

For this lab I will be creating a vulnerable virtual machine in Microsoft Azure running Windows 10. I will be installing a few old deprecated programs on to the machine to simulate a vulnerable environment. For scanning I'll be using Azure's builtin OpenVAS vulnerability management tool to create a vulnerability management server. After the scans are complete I will remediate the vulnerabilities found and verify they were removed.

## Creating an OpenVAS Virtual Machine and Logging in

The first part of the lab involves creating a virtual machine with OpenVAS in Microsoft Azure then confirming it's working by logging into it remotely.
As illustrated by the pictures below, I was able to create an OpenVAS VM and successfully loging through powershell utilizing ssh.

### Simulating the Testing Enviroment

For this next part I downloaded and installed a few very old software that would trigger some alerts in the scanner.
These are the programs that were installed below:
