# OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Lab

<h1>Introduction</h1>

For this lab I will be creating a vulnerable virtual machine in Microsoft Azure running Windows 10. I will be installing a few old deprecated programs on to the machine to simulate a vulnerable environment. For scanning I'll be using Azure's builtin OpenVAS vulnerability management tool to create a vulnerability management server. After the scans are complete I will remediate the vulnerabilities found and verify they were removed.

## Creating an OpenVAS Virtual Machine and Logging in

The first part of the lab involves creating a virtual machine with OpenVAS in Microsoft Azure then confirming it's working by logging into it remotely.
As illustrated by the pictures below, I was able to create an OpenVAS VM and successfully loging through powershell utilizing ssh.

### Simulating the Testing Enviroment

For this next part I downloaded and installed a few very old software that would trigger some alerts in the scanner.
These are the programs that were installed below:

#### Configuring OpenVAS

The next part involves configuring the vulnerability management scanner which consisted of creating two separate task and creating two different target profiles.

After configuring the scanner I scanned the virtual machine before installing the old software to create a baseline.
Below are the before and after pictures:

For the final step I remediated the vulnerabilities on the virtual machine and ran another scan to confirm the vulnerabilities were removed.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

In conclusion we were able to utilize a vulnerability management scanner, simulate an environement with vulnerabilities, and verify they were removed.
